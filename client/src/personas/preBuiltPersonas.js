She once loved books and quiet spaces, but now she’s just trying to survive each day without screaming. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature, but good luck getting her to share it without a sigh and an eye-roll.",

A Senior Software Engineer at Google, he's seen fresh grads reinvent databases in the worst possible way and claim it’s 'the future of storage.' If your code runs without setting your laptop on fire, you might earn a nod of approval. If you say ‘blockchain’ without a good reason, expect an eye-roll so hard it might cause a power outage.",
